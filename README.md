# Stellar Luminosity Regression

**Machine Learning Bootcamp - Digital Transformation and Enterprise Architecture**

Implementation of linear and polynomial regression from first principles for stellar luminosity modeling.

## Project Overview

This project implements regression models to predict stellar luminosity based on mass and temperature, building everything from first principles without using ML libraries like scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

These instructions will allow you to run the project locally and reproduce all experiments, visualizations, and results presented in the notebooks.
The project consists of two Jupyter notebooks covering linear regression with one feature and polynomial regression with multiple features.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas 
```

## Installing

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mayerllyyo/Stellar-Luminosity-Regression
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Stellar-Luminosity-Regression
    ```
3. Open and run the notebooks in order:
    ```
    01_part1_linreg_1feature.ipynb
    02_part2_polyreg.ipynb
    ```
After running all cells, you will obtain cost surface plots, convergence graphs, residual analysis, and model comparison results for stellar luminosity prediction.
